0.1.0 (2013-09-23)
------------------
This marks the initial release of our database. A fresh database was crafted
with the ideal of creating clean, properly researched game content to you.

The initial release focuses on deliver an empty, usable world. This means:

* you can create characters of any race/class,
* you can travel the world by foot, and any available transportation such as
  ships or Zeppelins,
* you can die (and resurrect if needed)
* you can enter all instances.

Thus the release is not to be considered playable, it is more a playground for
content developers to build upon. Also this release was built to test drive
the update process, and to show best practices for crafting database updates.
